Part 1: Your Portfolio (40%)

You are an investment fund manager and plan to invest a sum in a savings account and in Cryptocurrency.

Let ùë• represent the amount you invest in your saving account and ùë¶ represent the amount you invest in Cryptocurrency.

Before you begin investing, you need to start with research and Assignment Project Exam Helpconsider the following questions.

1. How much money do you have to invest?

2. Which Bank and savings account do you plan to invest with? Conduct your research on Australian

(personal savings) account, the interest rate, any, fees, terms and conditions and reference (with link) to the website where you attained that information.

4. Consider whether you are an investor who likes to take risk or not but selecting from the following options to describe how you plan to invest:

(1) The value of the cryptocurrency must be less than or equal to (select one: 2/3/4) times the value in your savings account.

(2) The value of the cryptocurrency must be greater than or equal to (select one:

50/60/70/80/90/100)% the value in your savings.

5. Research the potential returns you will make from your investments. Collate the rate of return from your savings account (from (2)) and last month‚Äôs rate of return from your cryptocurrency (from (3)).

6. Account for any assumptions and limitations from your research so far.

Your Task:

Collate the information from questions 1 ‚Äì 6 above and write a complete summary of your research so far. Do not list your answers to each question. You need to start with an introduction to the section and summarise each question in a cohesive report format.

In your report, use linear programming (by following the steps below) to find the amount you should invest in a savings account and in cryptocurrency to optimise your return. Let ùë• represent the amount you invest in your saving account and ùë¶ represent the amount you invest in Cryptocurrency.

a. State the objective (What are you optimising and are you maximising or minimising?)

b. Determine your constraints based on the information from question (1) and (4). You should find five constraints.

c. Determine the objective function from question (5).

d. Construct a detailed feasible region and solve the problem using linear programming techniques. Show all your calculations in typed equations format and caption all required graphs and images.

e. Write a conclusion to your investment situation.

Part 2: Your Mortgage (40%)

1. You have been able to make some profit from your investments in part 1. One year ago, you

purchased a house for $1000000 and have been paying the minimum monthly repayments amounts

at an interest rate of 2.59% p.a. compounded monthly. The loan you acquiredAssignment Project Exam Help was for a term of 30 years. You decide to put your entire returns from part 1 towards your current home loan as a lump sum payment after one year.

Your Task: Determine an additional strategy you can use to save on interest, describe to the reader what the strategy is, how it will save you interest, and any limitations to the strategy. Apply this strategy to your model from (1) (including the lump sum payment, and remembering that one year has already past) and calculate:

a. How long it will now take to pay off the loan.

b. The exact amount of interest saved with the two strategies applied together.

Part 3: Your Future (20%)
